<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a passionate and highly focused individual, with a keen enthusiasm and interest in Software Development/Engineering and Mathematics.. I have a solid understanding in both Python and am currently getting a hold of C++ . At the moment i am self studying with hope of going to do a MMath in Mathematics w/ Computer Science in Leeds or Warwick (Hopefully). I am most interested in Artifical intelligence and Computational coding as they have been two topics im most engrossed with for years, i also want to start developing an understanding of Cyber-securtity as CTF's and in-depth knowledge of the back-end of devices seem interesting. => got the interest having to flash my psvita, looking at the github repos of the methods of how they reverse engineered the code to run unauthorised code segements was confusing but seemed enjoyable. At the end of the day, this is just a documentation github page mostly for myself and to maybe change round at some point to show a recruiter or something.
